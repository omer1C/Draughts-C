# Draughts-C
Draughts play in C.

The known game of Draughts I build.

The rules are a bit diffrent:
1) You can not eat backwards or have more then one eat in a turn.
2) You win if you ate all of the rivel pawns or get to the other side of the board with one of your pawns.
3) Exit with typing 999 in one of the coordinate.

Enjoy!
