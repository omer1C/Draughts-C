# Draughts-C
Draughts play in C.
The known game of Draughts I build during systems programing course.
The rules are a bit diffrent:
1) You can not eat backwards.
2) You win if you ate all of the rivel pawns or get to the other side of the board with one of your pawns.
3) Exit with typing 999 in one of the coordinate.
Enjoy!
